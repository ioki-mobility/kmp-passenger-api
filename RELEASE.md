## ðŸ“¦ How to Release

### 1. Check out the `main` Branch

   - Ensure you are on the `main` branch and have pulled the latest changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull origin main
     ```

### 2. Update the Version in `build.gradle.kts`

   - Remove `-SNAPSHOT` from the `version` in [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts).
   - Commit the change (Note that it should not be pushed):
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Prepare next release" .
     ```

### 3. Create a Git Tag and Push It

   - Tag the release version and push it:
     ```bash
     git tag x.y.z
     git push origin x.y.z
     ```

### 4. Trigger the Release Action

   - This will kick off a [GitHub action (`release.yml`)](../../actions/workflows/release.yml) to release the library to a [Sonatype](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/) staging repository. ðŸ“¤
   - The action will also draft a [new release on GitHub](../../releases).

### 5. Sign in to Sonatype and Close the Staged Repo

   - Head to the [Central Portal](https://central.sonatype.com/publishing/deployments) and sign in (credentials are in the Bitwarden Open Source Collection).
   - Search for the artifacts you want to publish, click **Publish**.

### 6. Edit the Release on GitHub

   - After step 4 is complete, head to the [GitHub release page](../../releases) and edit the new release, and publish it. ðŸŽ‰

### 7. Bump the Version for Development

   - Increment the **minor** (Major.Minor.Patch) version in [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts) and add `-SNAPSHOT` to indicate the next development version.
   - Commit this change:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Next development version" .
     ```

### 8. Push and Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’ƒ

   - Push your changes and celebrate a job well done!
